# Hospitalcapacity
Predicting The Daily Occupancy Demands of Ontario's Critical Care Units During the Covid Pandemic

# Objectives
The objectives of is project are:

- To explore and analyze hospital ICU occupancy during the pandemic in Ontario
- To identify patterns and trends in ICU hospitalizations along the progression of the virus
- To develop machine learning models that predict the daily occupancy demands of Ontario's critical care units using patterns found in earlier stages of the pandemic
- Provide recommendations for hospitals to increase their preparedness for high patient volumes and needs in the future

# Significance
By examining Ontario's availability of ICU beds and occupancy for COVID-related critical illness (CRCI) dataset, we will identify the important patterns and trends in ICU hospitalizations, and use machine learning models with which hospitals can use as a reference to modify their responses in anticipation of upcoming volumes. 

# Project Folder Directory
